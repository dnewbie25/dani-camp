## How To Use

1.  **Start the application**: Make sure you have the frontend running (e.g., with `npm run dev`) and the FastAPI server is active.
2.  **Add your ingredients**: On the main page, you'll see an input field. Type in an ingredient you have (e.g., "chicken", "rice", "broccoli") and click the "Add ingredient" button.
3.  **Build your list**: Continue adding all the ingredients you want to use. They will appear in a list.
4.  **Get a recipe**: Once you're ready, click the "Get Recipe" button.
5.  **Enjoy your recipe**: The app will make a call to the AI chef and display a recipe in a nicely formatted way. The recipe will be generated using some or all of the ingredients you provided.
