## What it does

The Meme Generator allows users to create and share funny memes by adding text to a random image. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their desired text, and then generates a meme with the text overlaid on a random image.

## How it works

1. The application uses a library of pre-loaded images, which are randomly selected and displayed on the screen.
2. The user inputs their desired text, which is then overlaid on top of the image using HTML and CSS.
3. The application uses JavaScript to handle user input, generate the meme, and update the display in real-time.
