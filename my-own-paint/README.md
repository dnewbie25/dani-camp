# My Own Paint - v.1.1.0

This app is my own version of the popular `Paint` app, created using the `HTML Canvas element` so it can be used from the browser.

## How to Use

You can draw inside the canvas marked by the dotted blue line. You can select a color to draw or click the `Eraser` button at the right to clean the whole canvas. After clearing the canvas, the color will remain as the last color selected.

Keep in mind that if you resize the page, you will loose your progress, as resizing while working is not yet supported.
