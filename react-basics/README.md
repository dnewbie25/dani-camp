# React Basics

This app is just a very simple copy of a clicker app. The `Press` button will increment the count on screen.

# Why this app even exist?

It was only made for learning purposes. In 2023 React deprecated `create-react-app`, having now as the new project setup options to use a framework as `Next.js` or use the bundler mentioned in the home page of the React documentation, which is `Vite`, instead of Webpack which was the most popular bundler for years. I wanted to see how difficult was to start a new project in 2024 using Webpack (TL;DR it was hard).


For all the troubles Webpack gave me when setting the new project, I think that at least for learning React, the go-to option is clear: `Vite`.
