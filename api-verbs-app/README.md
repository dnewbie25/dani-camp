# API Verbs App

This is a basic JS and HTML app to test API verbs like PUT, POST, GET and DELETE using a dummy API that I created called [API-Verbs-App](https://github.com/dnewbie25/API-Verbs-App).

## How to use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the API-Verbs-App API endpoints to test the different API verbs. Each verb can be tested using an input field that will show in screen what has been retrieved.

## Endpoints

* GET: https://api-verbs-app.onrender.com/get
* POST: https://api-verbs-app.onrender.com/post
* PUT: https://api-verbs-app.onrender.com/put
* DELETE: https://api-verbs-app.onrender.com/delete

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Postman-Echo API
* Python and FastAPI for the API-Verbs-App
