# Zodiac Sign Calculator

This very simple app gets the Zodiac sign based on the birthdate entered.

It was developed in `React` with `Vite` as the build tool. In the app you can select a calendar. In this app I used `useState` to build the app and handle the birthday selection and the app "remembers" the user inputs and updates the result without clearing the calendar after each input.
