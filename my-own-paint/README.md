## How to Use

You can draw inside the canvas marked by the dotted blue line. You can select a color to draw, click the `Eraser` button to erase portions of the drawing or click the `Trash` button to clear the whole canvas. After clearing the canvas, the color will reset to black.

It has touch controls activated, but they are not accurate. It might erase the content when using on mobile devices and trying to scroll up or down.

Remember that if you resize or refresh the page, you will lose your progress, as the app does not save the drawing.
